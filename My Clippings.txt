設定太不具野心的目標，有時也會適得其反。例如，那些不敢擁有遠大志向的人，最後可能會交差了事或工作效率很低，因為他們沒有去想得更大更遠，因而沒有專注去發展出伸縮自如的做事方式。

對何時何地執行一項新習慣做出確切計畫的人，比較可能真的去執行。太多人還沒搞清楚這些基本細節，就去嘗試改變自己的習慣。我們告訴自己「我要吃得健康一點」或「我要多寫一些文章」，但從來沒說這些習慣要在何時何地發生；我們把這些事交給機遇，期待自己會「突然記得要做」，或是在對的時候剛好受到激勵。執行意向掃除模糊的概念，像是「我要多運動」或「我要更有生產力」或「我該去投票」，以具體的行動計畫取而代之。 　　許多人認為自己缺乏激勵，其實他們缺的是清晰。採取行動的時間與地點並非總是顯而易見，有些人花了一輩子等待改善自我的正確時機。

Healthy Nines are natural mediators. They see and value the perspective of other people and can harmonize what seem to be irreconcilable points of view.

Average Nines, while they come off as sweet and easygoing, are stubborn and out of touch with their anger. These Nines overlook themselves. Though they generally feel unimportant, they occasionally wake up and realize they have to work on investing in themselves.

Unhealthy Nines have trouble making decisions and become overly dependent. To dull feelings of sadness and anger they engage in numbing behaviors.

Average Nines are disconnected from the passion and motivational drive necessary to rise up and live their “one wild and precious life.” Immature Nines don’t fully connect to the fire in the belly they need to chase after their God-given life and, as a result, fail to become their own person. But tapping into those fiery passions and instinctual drives would upset the inner peace and equilibrium the Nine treasures above almost everything else.

Unfortunately, from this privileged position Nines tend to see the world from the viewpoint of every number but their own. Or as Riso and Hudson put it, “The only type the Nine is not like is the Nine itself.”

If anxiety is the cause of their retreat to the inner sanctum, they’ll think, Why am I upset right now? Is this my fault or someone else’s? Or at times they simply retreat to reconnect to or recover their comforting, albeit illusionary, sense of interior peace.

All this fence sitting leads to procrastination, which can drive the rest of the world crazy. Though you may not pick up on it at first, the more you pressure a Nine to make a decision or do something the more they quietly dig their heels in and resist. Nines can and do make decisions, but given their ambivalent nature it can take them a long time.

Because they don’t know when or how to say no to people, they feel angry that others seem to take advantage of their seeming inability to set boundaries in relationships.

If you do something to make a Nine angry on Monday morning, they often won’t feel it until Tuesday afternoon. Come Tuesday night you’ll know they have their hackles up with you over something when you ask whether they fulfilled their promise to pick up your dress from the dry cleaner for your important business trip tomorrow and in a nearly repentant tone of voice they say, “Oh dear, I forgot.”

Ten Paths to Transformation for Nines Journal on the question “What is my calling or life’s program? Am I pursuing it or postponing it to keep the peace?” Ask someone to help you find a task-management or to-do system to help you stay on task. There are lots of great apps out there just for this purpose. Practice saying no when someone asks you to do something you don’t want to. Be aware of the numbing strategies you use to avoid having to deal with life, whether that’s a glass of wine or shopping or Girl Scout cookies. Don’t be afraid to have opinions and express them. You can start with small things and build up to important ones. Resist the urge to fall back on passive-aggressive behaviors like procrastination and avoidance. If you feel angry, be honest and open. Understand how important and unique your voice is. People deserve to hear what you think, not have their own views mirrored back to them. Remember that what feels like intense, terrible conflict to you might just be a typical disagreement for someone else. Take a breath and engage. Realize that your tendency to merge with others can be a beautiful gift if directed toward God. Other types envy this spiritual advantage you have. But don’t fuse with another person and miss out on the chance to become your own person. When you feel paralyzed in the face of a decision, consult someone who won’t tell you what to do but rather will help you tease out what you want to do—then do it!

The degree of likelihood and the size of potential impact are two of the biggest lies we tell ourselves. That’s a problem because risk is a function of likelihood multiplied by potential impact. Human biases tend to distort both of these concepts. How we perceive impact depends on who a risk might affect and how we feel about them; how close or far in time and distance; and how widespread and severe effects might be. All of these are extremely subjective.

The soft negotiator wants to avoid personal conflict and so makes concessions readily to reach agreement. He or she wants an amicable resolution; yet often ends up exploited and feeling bitter. The hard negotiator sees any situation as a contest of wills in which the side that takes the more extreme positions and holds out longer fares better. He or she wants to win; yet often ends up producing an equally hard response that exhausts the negotiator and his or her resources and harms the relationship with the other side.

Any method of negotiation may be fairly judged by three criteria: It should produce a wise agreement if agreement is possible. It should be efficient. And it should improve or at least not damage the relationship between the parties. (A wise agreement can be defined as one that meets the legitimate interests of each side to the extent possible, resolves conflicting interests fairly, is durable, and takes community interests into account.)

People: Separate the people from the problem. Interests: Focus on interests, not positions. Options: Invent multiple options looking for mutual gains before deciding what to do. Criteria: Insist that the result be based on some objective standard.

To sum up, in contrast to positional bargaining, the principled negotiation method of focusing on basic interests, mutually satisfying options, and fair standards typically results in a wise agreement. The method permits you to reach a gradual consensus on a joint decision efficiently without all the transactional costs of digging in to positions only to have to dig yourself out of them. And separating the people from the problem allows you to deal directly and empathetically with the other negotiator as a human being regardless of any substantive differences, thus making possible an amicable outcome.

It is all too easy to fall into the habit of putting the worst interpretation on what the other side says or does. A suspicious interpretation often follows naturally from one’s existing perceptions. Moreover, it seems the “safe” thing to do, and it shows spectators how bad the other side really is.

This is precisely what people tend not to do. When you have a difficult issue to handle, your instinct is to leave the hard part until last. “Let’s be sure we have the whole thing worked out before we approach the Commissioner.” The Commissioner, however, is much more likely to agree to a revision of the regulations if he feels that he has had a part in drafting it.

Often in a negotiation people will continue to hold out not because the proposal on the table is inherently unacceptable, but simply because they want to avoid the feeling or the appearance of backing down to the other side. If the substance can be phrased or conceptualized differently so that it seems a fair outcome, they will then accept it.

Many emotions in negotiation are driven by a core set of five interests: autonomy, the desire to make your own choices and control your own fate; appreciation, the desire to be recognized and valued; affiliation, the desire to belong as an accepted member of some peer group; role, the desire to have a meaningful purpose; and status, the desire to feel fairly seen and acknowledged.

As you repeat what you understood them to have said, phrase it positively from their point of view, making the strength of their case clear. You might say, “You have a strong case. Let me see if I can explain it. Here’s the way it strikes me. . . .” Understanding is not agreeing.

It is more persuasive, however, to describe a problem in terms of its impact on you than in terms of what they did or why: “I feel let down” instead of “You broke your word.” “We feel discriminated against” rather than “You’re a racist.” If you make a statement about them that they believe is untrue, they will ignore you or get angry; they will not focus on your concern. But a statement about how you feel is difficult to challenge.

the best time for handling people problems is before they become people problems. This means building a personal and organizational relationship with the other side that can cushion the people on each side against the knocks of negotiation. It also means structuring the negotiating game in ways that disentangle the substantive problem from the relationship and protect people’s egos from getting involved in substantive discussions.

Reconciling interests rather than positions works for two reasons. First, for every interest there usually exist several possible positions that could satisfy it. All too often people simply adopt the most obvious position, as Israel did, for example, in announcing that they intended to keep part of the Sinai. When you do look behind opposed positions for the motivating interests, you can often find an alternative position that meets not only your interests but theirs as well.

There seems to be no way to split the pie that leaves both parties satisfied. Often you are negotiating along a single dimension, such as the amount of territory, the price of a car, the length of a lease on an apartment, or the size of a commission on a sale. At other times you face what appears to be an either/or choice that is either markedly favorable to you or to the other side.

To invent creative options, then, you will need to (1) separate the act of inventing options from the act of judging them; (2) broaden the options on the table rather than look for a single answer; (3) search for mutual gains; and (4) invent ways of making their decisions easy.

To reduce the risk of appearing committed to any given idea, you can make a habit of advancing at least two alternatives at the same time.

Three points about shared interests are worth remembering. First, shared interests lie latent in every negotiation. They may not be immediately obvious. Ask yourself: Do we have a shared interest in preserving our relationship? What opportunities lie ahead for cooperation and mutual benefit? What costs would we bear if negotiations broke off? Are there common principles, like a fair price, that we both can respect?

Second, shared interests are opportunities, not godsends. To be of use, you need to make something out of them. It helps to make a shared interest explicit and to formulate it as a shared goal. In other words, make it concrete and future-oriented. As manager of Townsend Oil, for example, you could set a joint goal with the mayor of bringing five new industries into Pageville within three years.

To evaluate an option from the other side’s point of view, consider how they might be criticized if they adopted it.

you can usually shift the process from positional bargaining to a search for objective criteria. In this sense principled negotiation is a dominant strategy over positional bargaining. One who insists that negotiation be based on the merits can bring others around to playing that game, since that becomes the only way to advance their substantive interests.

On substance, too, you are likely to do well. Particularly for those who might otherwise be browbeaten by a positional bargainer, principled negotiation allows you to hold your own and still be fair. Principle serves as your hardhearted partner who will not let you yield to pressure. It is a form of “right makes might.”

If there is no give in their position and you find no principled basis for accepting it, you should assess what you might gain by accepting their unjustified position rather than going to your best alternative. You should weigh that substantive benefit against the benefit to your reputation as a principled negotiator that could come from walking away.

In response to power, the most any method of negotiation can do is to meet two objectives: first, to protect you against making an agreement you should reject and second, to help you make the most of the assets you do have so that any agreement you reach will satisfy your interests as well as possible.

What is your BATNA—your Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement? That is the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured. That is the only standard that can protect you both from accepting terms that are too unfavorable and from rejecting terms it would be in your interest to accept.

In your mind you are likely to find the sum of these alternatives more attractive than working for a specific salary in a particular job. The difficulty is that you cannot have the sum total of all those other alternatives; if you fail to reach agreement, you will have to choose just one.

The better your BATNA, the greater your power. People think of negotiating power as being determined by resources like wealth, political connections, physical strength, friends, and military might. In fact, the relative negotiating power of two parties depends primarily upon how attractive to each is the option of not reaching agreement.

Rejecting their position only locks them in. Defending your proposal only locks you in. And defending yourself sidetracks the negotiation into a clash of personalities.

Let’s say you represent an association of teachers striking for higher pay and for seniority as the only criterion in layoffs. The school board has proposed a $2,000 raise across the board plus retention of the right to decide unilaterally who gets laid off. Mine their position for the interests that lie below the surface. “What exactly are the budget trade-offs involved in raising the salary schedule more than $2,000?” “Why do you feel a need to maintain complete control over layoffs?” Assume every position they take is a genuine attempt to address the basic concerns of each side; ask them how they think it addresses the problem at hand. Treat their position as one option and objectively examine the extent to which it meets the interests of each party, or might be improved to do so. “How will a $2,000 across-the-board increase keep our schools’ salaries competitive with others in the area and thus assure that the students will have high-quality teachers?” “How could you satisfy the teachers that your evaluation procedure for layoffs would be fair? We believe that you personally would be fair, but what would happen if you left? How can we leave our livelihoods and our families’ wellbeing up to a potentially arbitrary decision?”

在討厭的時候、痛苦的時候、筋疲力盡的時候還是挺身繼續，這就是專業人士與業餘者的差別。 　　專業人士堅守既定行程，業餘者接受生活的干擾；專業人士知道什麼事情對自己最重要，帶著決心奮力向前，業餘者則讓生活中的緊急事件拽離正軌。

聰明不如好奇：擁有動機與好奇心比聰明有用，因為會帶來行動。光是聰明，永遠不會產生成果，因為聰明無法讓你行動。刺激行為的是欲望，不是智力。如企業家兼投資人納瓦爾．拉威康特所言：「做任何事的要訣就是先培養對那件事的欲望。」

Get it in writing. Let’s suppose you want your employee to submit reports in a more timely fashion. Once you believe you’ve won agreement, ask him to summarize the decision in a memo and send it to you. By doing so, you’ll have greatly increased the odds that he’ll fulfill the commitment because, as a rule, people live up to what they have written down.

1. The first dysfunction is an absence of trust among team members. Essentially, this stems from their unwillingness to be vulnerable within the group. Team members who are not genuinely open with one another about their mistakes and weaknesses make it impossible to build a foundation for trust. 2. This failure to build trust is damaging because it sets the tone for the second dysfunction: fear of conflict. Teams that lack trust are incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas. Instead, they resort to veiled discussions and guarded comments. 3. A lack of healthy conflict is a problem because it ensures the third dysfunction of a team: lack of commitment. Without having aired their opinions in the course of passionate and open debate, team members rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions, though they may feign agreement during meetings. 4. Because of this lack of real commitment and buy-in, team members develop an avoidance of accountability, the fourth dysfunction. Without committing to a clear plan of action, even the most focused and driven people often hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team. 5. Failure to hold one another accountable creates an environment where the fifth dysfunction can thrive. Inattention to results occurs when team members put their individual needs (such as ego, career development, or recognition) or even the needs of their divisions above the collective goals of the team.

The most important action that a leader must take to encourage the building of trust on a team is to demonstrate vulnerability first. This requires that a leader risk losing face in front of the team, so that subordinates will take the same risk themselves. What is more, team leaders must create an environment that does not punish vulnerability

我承認我把週期的上下起伏與鐘擺的左右擺動交替討論，把某些現象貼上週期的標籤，而且（如第七章提到）把其他現象貼上鐘擺的標籤（通常與人的心態有關）。有時候我會把某個特定現象當成週期來討論，有時候則會當成鐘擺討論。但被追問為什麼的時候，我發現很難區分這兩件事，或是說，為什麼一個要稱作週期，而不是鐘擺。

意味著從一個高點或低點回頭擺盪時，幾乎從不會停在中點……不論中點如何「正確」或「適當」。你可以高度信賴它會通過中點，繼續往相反的極端變動。舉例來說，市場很少會從「低估」（underpriced）到「公平價格」（fairly priced），然後停下來。通常的情況是，讓市場從不景氣的水準復甦的基本面改善與上漲的樂觀情緒依然會繼續施力，導致它們通過「公平價格」，繼續達到「高估」的狀態。這未必會發生，但通常會出現這種情況。

工作時數是決定每年經濟產出的一項主要因素。反過來說，工作時數增加最根本的因素是人口成長。人口成長意味著每年有更多的人在製造與銷售產品（而且有更多人買進和消費產品，鼓勵生產）。生產更多，等於有更多的GDP。如果人口成長，工作時數往往會增加，因此GDP也會增加。所以出生率通常被假定是會使經濟成長往正向發展的主要原因之一。另一方面，如果人口減少，經濟成長就會面臨明顯的阻力。

A rumble is a discussion, conversation, or meeting defined by a commitment to lean into vulnerability, to stay curious and generous, to stick with the messy middle of problem identification and solving, to take a break and circle back when necessary, to be fearless in owning our parts, and, as psychologist Harriet Lerner teaches, to listen with the same passion with which we want to be heard.

During a time of difficult change and uncertainty, daring leaders might sit with their teams and say, These changes are coming in hard and fast, and I know there’s a lot of anxiety—I’m feeling it too, and it’s hard to work through. It’s hard not to take it home, it’s hard not to worry, and it’s easy to want to look for someone to blame. I will share everything I can about the changes with you, as soon as I can. I want to spend the next forty-five minutes rumbling on how we’re all managing the changes. Specifically, What does support from me look like? What questions can I try to answer? Are there any stories you want to check out with me? And any other questions you have?

“He said it would be a lot easier for me to do well if he gave me crystal-clear feedback on how I was doing. He said it would help me succeed—that I had talent and he wanted to keep me.

He cautioned me that it might not be very comfortable at first for either of us.”

We define middle managers as the people who are at least once removed from the front line and at least a layer below the senior leadership. From this pivotal position, a middle manager’s job is to bring out the best in their people, and in that way bring out the best in their organizations. They do this best by serving as navigators, connectors, and coaches. But in most cases senior leaders, failing to realize this, are putting their middle managers to the wrong use. They are using them as a kind of catch-all to do all the tasks that no one else is willing, able, or available to do. As a result, managers are suffering under a host of burdens and stresses that have stretched them beyond their limits (figure 1-1). And they are being blamed for outcomes that are not their fault.

“In many cases, the norms and expectations associated with being a leader (e.g., assertiveness) are incompatible with the norms and expectations with being a subordinate (e.g., deference). This becomes problematic when one is called upon to play both roles at work because humans are notoriously inefficient when it comes to task switching.”
